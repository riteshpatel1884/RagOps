"""
Phase 4: Diagnostic Engine — "Why is my RAG bad?"

Takes the metrics Phase 1 (retrieval) and Phase 2 (generation) already
compute — recall, precision, mrr, ndcg, faithfulness, relevance — and turns
a bare number like "Recall@5 = 0.45" into an actual diagnosis: which stage
is the bottleneck, why, and what to try next.

This module is pure rule-based reasoning over metrics that already exist —
no new evaluators, no LLM calls. It's meant to sit on top of a single
Phase 1/2 run (`diagnose_config`) or an entire Phase 3 experiment sweep
(`diagnose_experiment_results` + `pareto_frontier`).

IMPORTANT — these thresholds are heuristics, not universal truths.
They were chosen to be reasonable defaults for a small (~10-50 question)
evaluation set, but the right thresholds genuinely depend on your domain,
dataset size, and risk tolerance. Treat them as a starting point to tune,
not a fixed spec — that tuning is itself worth mentioning in an interview.
